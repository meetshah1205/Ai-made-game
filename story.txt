Zyntax: Detailed Story
Prologue: Jeffery, a wandering folk singer, finds himself lost in an unforgiving jungle after narrowly escaping a sinister force. His supplies are running low, and exhaustion sets in. Hungry and desperate, he stumbles across an ancient, dilapidated mansion that seems out of place amidst the wilderness. The mansion, though seemingly abandoned, has an eerie aura that pulls Jeffery in. Inside, he is greeted by a friendly yet mysterious cook who offers him some food. But as soon as he begins to eat, he notices something strange—the cook’s nervousness, the hushed whispers, and the ever-watchful eyes. Before Jeffery can inquire further, they are interrupted by a voice coming from deeper within the mansion: “Who's there?”

Act 1: The Mansion’s Secrets Jeffery is terrified but tries to act nonchalant, explaining that he only sought food. The cook tells him to stay quiet, reassuring him that it’s just the lord of the house, Kodumon Potti. He soon learns that this mansion is no ordinary house. Strange things happen at night, and the mansion seems to shift and change, as if the walls themselves are alive. The cook warns Jeffery not to venture too far and not to trust anyone inside.

As Jeffery explores, he learns of a dark past tied to the mansion—Kodumon Potti is the descendant of an ancient line of rulers who once held a powerful goblin (a shape-shifting entity) captive, using its dark powers for personal gain. However, the goblin, angered by centuries of mistreatment, used its magic to escape, killing many in the family and trapping those who remained in the mansion. It now controls the house and its inhabitants, manipulating them to serve its will. Over time, the mansion has become a prison of sorts, cursed and haunted by the restless souls of its former inhabitants.

Act 2: Unraveling the Curse Jeffery begins to unravel the curse that haunts the mansion. He discovers the existence of an ancient ritual, believed to weaken the goblin and possibly imprison it again. To perform the ritual, Jeffery must locate three powerful artifacts hidden throughout the mansion and the surrounding jungle, each tied to a lost ancestor of the Potti family. These artifacts are scattered in dangerous places—rooms locked by puzzles, ancient temples hidden in the jungle, and caves protected by dangerous creatures.

Along the way, Jeffery encounters other survivors—each with their own stories, fears, and agendas. One such survivor is the cook, who secretly harbors his own connection to the goblin and wishes to either destroy or harness its power for himself. Jeffery must decide whether to trust him, help him, or expose his true motives.

The mansion itself seems to come alive, with walls shifting, doors disappearing, and strange noises growing louder each night. As the goblin's power increases, more supernatural forces emerge—possessed animals, vengeful spirits, and shapeshifting entities that try to stop Jeffery from completing his task.

Act 3: The Goblin’s True Form As Jeffery collects the artifacts and uncovers more of the mansion’s secrets, he discovers that the goblin is far more powerful than he ever imagined. It can take on various forms, including that of a trusted ally, making it difficult to distinguish friend from foe. The mansion begins to shift violently as the goblin senses Jeffery’s growing threat and begins attacking him directly.

Jeffery learns of an ancient lamp that has burned eternally in the mansion’s heart. It is said that extinguishing the lamp will weaken the goblin, but doing so is risky—if Jeffery fails, the goblin will become more powerful than ever. He must navigate the mansion’s traps, fight supernatural forces, and solve increasingly complex puzzles to reach the lamp and put an end to the goblin’s reign.

Act 4: The Final Confrontation In the climax of the game, Jeffery must confront the goblin, who reveals its true form—a giant, monstrous creature that feeds off fear and darkness. The final battle is a multi-phase fight, where Jeffery must use everything he’s learned and collected throughout the game. The goblin will change its form, manipulating the environment and trying to break Jeffery’s resolve.

During the battle, Jeffery has the opportunity to either banish the goblin, trapping it once again in the mansion, or break the curse forever, which would free the mansion and its inhabitants. However, both options come with a cost. Banishment keeps the goblin contained, but it could return in the future. Breaking the curse, on the other hand, could release an even greater threat lurking beneath the mansion.

Epilogue: Depending on the choices Jeffery makes throughout the game, the ending changes:

Escape the Mansion: Jeffery successfully escapes, either with his life or with an ultimate sacrifice, but the jungle outside has grown darker and more dangerous, hinting that the goblin’s influence still lingers.
Breaking the Curse: Jeffery traps the goblin, breaking the curse and freeing the mansion’s trapped souls. However, the mansion crumbles around him as a consequence, leaving Jeffery to wonder if the goblin’s power was ever fully extinguished.
Embrace the Goblin’s Power: In the darkest ending, Jeffery succumbs to the goblin’s manipulation and becomes its new vessel, doomed to continue the cycle of horror in the mansion.
